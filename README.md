Using DIA or any other free software of your choice to create an ERD, draw an ER
diagram which indicates the entities and their attributes (if noted). Identify and label
significant relationships between pairs of entities.

Create a Crow’s Foot ERD for each of the following descriptions. (Note that the
word "many" is meant to mean "more than one" in a database modelling environment.).

*Note. Include all your ERDs in one file.*

**Data Descriptions:**
1. Each of the MegaCo Corporation’s divisions is composed of many departments. Each of the departments has many employees assigned to it, but each employee works for only one department. Each department is managed by one employee, and each of these managers can manage only one department at a time.
2. During some period of time, a customer can rent many videotapes from the BigVid store. Each of the BigVid’s videotapes can be rented to many customers during that period of time.
3. An airline can be assigned to fly many flights, but each flight is flown by only one airline.
4. The KwikTite Corporation operates many factories. Each factory is located in a region. Each region can be "home" to many of KwikTite’s factories. Each factory employs many employees, but each of these employees is employed by only one factory.
5. An employee may have earned many degrees, and each degree may have been earned by many employees.
